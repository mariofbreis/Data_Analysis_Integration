# Data Analysis Integration
 Project for the Data Analysis and Integration course

This project consisted in the performance of two main tasks:

1) To create an integrated view of the employee data that exists in the Northwind database and in the “company” database:
- The schema matching between both databases. A list of the correspondences between each table/column in the Northwind database and each table/column in the “company” database.
- The common (mediated) schema between both databases.
- The schema mapping (i.e. views) to retrieve data from both databases at the same time.
- A transformation to detect approximate duplicates between the job titles in both databases.

2) To create a data warehouse from the Northwind database, and write an interesting query that can be used for analysis and reporting purposes:
- The SQL instructions needed to create the data warehouse tables.
- The transformations (and jobs) to implement the ETL process in Pentaho Data Integration (PDI).
- The XML cube definition created with Pentaho Schema Workbench (PSW).
- An interesting MDX query and a screenshot of its results as displayed in Saiku Analytics.
- A report created with Pentaho Report Designer (PRD).

Installation instructions are provided for Windows, Ubuntu, and Mac OS in "software-installation-guide.pdf".
